Introduction
------------

This will be used as a sample to display some of my analytical capabilities in R. This project will focus on demonstrating how useful R can be to perform analysis that is easy to reproduce and communicate. This is by no means an exhaustive demonstration of my proficiency with R, but should highlight common data analysis functions that I perform regularly.

Analysis Goals
--------------

Forecasting can be a useful when try to prepare for future events. In this work sample I will demonstrate some of my forecasting capabilities with U.S. dairy transactional data. I will begin the process by examining, cleaning, and transforming the data. Next I will perform some exploratory analysis to get a better understanding of the data. Last up will run multiple models on the data, determine which performs best, and use that model to forecast price movements across all dairy products.

Data Sources
